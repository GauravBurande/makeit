## TODO list:

- IMPORTANT: change logo and branding on stripe account
- also the stripe webhook value in the stripe dashboard with the custom domain
- also how to reset monthly usage limits when user purchases yearly plan?(not so important now), a daily cron job!
- add customer support for pro and premium usrs
- maybe add watermark implementation for images in personal plan tier
- prompt suggest feature (ok maybe if needed)
- also add the privacy-policy and the tos
- email user's when abandoned cart (does stripe does that itself or will it need it's own cron job?)
- have transactional and marketing emails flow
- research and development on ai models for best interior images, testing and setup on runpod.io (later)
- now's just empty rooms or redesign rooms, add sketch to result too with advance comfyui workflow on runpod.io
- user can download image, copy prompt, favourite and delete them or maybe edit if user asked for such feature.

## faqs:

- Will I always get nice images? answer: Sometimes based on your input, our ai model will try it's best but still generate not so nice images.
